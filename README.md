# GSE Fleet Status 2025

A glass cockpit view of the deice operation. The dashboard tracks the four DS-series trucks alongside
the Type I and Type IV bulk tanks so ramp leaders can validate readiness at a glance, and it now ships
with a mobile-friendly portal so crews can edit the data on the ramp.

## Features

- **Command deck hero** summarizing running trucks, heater posture, and combined fluid reserves.
- **Fluid availability tiles** that stack truck loads against bulk storage for both Type I and Type IV.
- **Deice truck cards** showing real-time fluid levels, fuel reserves, heater status, and operator notes
  for assets DS032 through DS035.
- **Bulk tank monitors** outlining remaining gallons, percentage full, and last gauge checks for each
  storage tank.
- **Field update portal** with sliders, toggles, and text inputs to refresh fluid levels, fuel, statuses,
  assignments, and notes directly from a phone.
- **Neon glass aesthetic** with responsive layout tuned for tablets on the ramp.
